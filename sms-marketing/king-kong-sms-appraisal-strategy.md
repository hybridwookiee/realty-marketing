## King Kong Principles Applied to SMS

### Principle 1: Direct Response Marketing

**What It Means**: Every SMS must have a clear call-to-action that gets immediate response.

**SMS Application**:
- ❌ Bad: "We provide property appraisals. Contact us if interested."
- ✅ Good: "New property in [Suburb] matches your criteria. View now: [Link] or reply PROPERTIES for more."

**Key Elements**:
- Clear action: "Reply YES", "Call [Phone]", "View: [Link]"
- Immediate value: Why should they act now?
- Low friction: Easy to respond

---

### Principle 2: Funnel-Based Thinking

**What It Means**: Guide people through a journey from awareness to action.

**SMS Application**:
- **Awareness Stage**: "Free property appraisal available in Gippsland"
- **Interest Stage**: "5 reasons to get an appraisal in [Suburb]"
- **Consideration Stage**: "Recent sales in your area show strong market"
- **Action Stage**: "Ready to book? Reply YES or call [Phone]"

**Progression**:
1. Welcome SMS (immediate)
2. Value SMS (Day 2)
3. Market Update SMS (Day 5)
4. Social Proof SMS (Day 8)
5. Urgency SMS (Day 12)
6. Re-engagement SMS (Day 30)

---

### Principle 3: Copywriting (Persuasive SMS)

**What It Means**: Every word matters. Write SMS that persuades action.

**SMS Copywriting Formula** (King Kong Style):

**Formula**: Attention → Interest → Desire → Action (AIDA)

**Example**:
```
[Attention] Hi [Name]!
[Interest] New property in [Suburb]: 3br 2ba $450k
[Desire] Large yard, close to schools, perfect for families
[Action] View: [Link] or reply PROPERTIES for more
```

**Key Copywriting Elements for SMS**:
- **Headline/Opening**: First 3 words grab attention
- **Benefits over Features**: "Save time" not "Automated system"
- **Social Proof**: "247,000+ satisfied clients"
- **Urgency**: "Limited appraisals this month"
- **Specificity**: "50 appraisals per month" not "many appraisals"

---

### Principle 4: Lead Magnets (Free Value)

**What It Means**: Give something valuable to capture leads.

**SMS Lead Magnets**:
- Free property appraisal (primary)
- Free market report for their suburb
- Free property valuation calculator
- Free "Ultimate Guide to Selling in Gippsland"

**SMS Application**:
```
"Hi [Name]! Get your free [Suburb] market report: 
[Link]. Shows recent sales, price trends, and what 
your property might be worth. Reply STOP to opt out."
```

---

### Principle 5: Automation (Nurture Sequences)

**What It Means**: Automated SMS sent over time to nurture leads.

**Why SMS Automation Works**:
- Most people don't book immediately
- SMS keeps you top-of-mind (98% open rate)
- Builds trust over time
- Converts "not ready" into "ready"

**The SMS Sequence** (King Kong Style):
- SMS 1: Welcome (immediate)
- SMS 2: Value (Day 2)
- SMS 3: Market Update (Day 5)
- SMS 4: Social Proof (Day 8)
- SMS 5: Urgency (Day 12)
- SMS 6: Re-engagement (Day 30)

**Key Insight**: Most appraisals happen after 5-7 touches. SMS automation does this automatically.

---

### Principle 6: Sales Psychology

**What It Means**: Use psychology to influence behavior.

**SMS Psychology Principles**:

1. **Reciprocity**: Give value first
   - "Here's a free market update for [Suburb]..."

2. **Scarcity**: Limited availability
   - "Only 5 appraisal slots left this month"

3. **Social Proof**: Others have done this
   - "247,000+ satisfied clients trust @realty"

4. **Authority**: Expert positioning
   - "30+ years Gippsland real estate experience"

5. **Commitment**: Small yes leads to big yes
   - "Reply YES for free appraisal" → Later: "Ready to list?"

6. **Liking**: Personal connection
   - Use their name, reference their suburb

---

### Principle 7: Data-Driven Optimization

**What It Means**: Test, measure, and improve based on data.

**SMS Metrics to Track**:
- **Open Rate**: 98% (SMS standard)
- **Response Rate**: Target 20-30%
- **Click-Through Rate**: Target 15-25% (if links included)
- **Appraisal Booking Rate**: Target 10-15% of SMS recipients
- **Cost per Appraisal**: Target $50-150 AUD

**A/B Testing Ideas**:
- Test different opening lines
- Test send times (morning vs afternoon)
- Test with/without emojis
- Test short vs longer messages
- Test different CTAs ("Reply YES" vs "Call [Phone]" vs "View: [Link]")

**The Process**:
1. Test (try something)
2. Measure (see results)
3. Learn (what worked?)
4. Optimise (do more of what works)
5. Repeat
