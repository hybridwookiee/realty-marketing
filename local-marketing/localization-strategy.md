# Localization Strategy: Attracting Local Customers & Reducing Non-Local Followers

## The Problem

You're getting followers and engagement from people outside your service area (Gippsland: Warragul, Drouin, Yarragon, Trafalgar). This dilutes your marketing efforts and wastes ad spend on people who can't use your services.

**Current Issues:**
- 7,000+ fake followers from outside Australia (China, Pakistan, India)
- Organic followers from outside Gippsland
- Ads reaching people who can't buy/sell in your area
- Low engagement from non-local followers affecting algorithm

## Strategy Overview

**Three-Pronged Approach:**
1. **Prevent** non-local followers from finding you
2. **Target** only local audiences in ads and content
3. **Engage** with local community to build authentic local following

## 1. Social Media Localization

### Facebook & Instagram Settings

#### A. Geographic Restrictions

**Facebook Page Settings:**
1. Go to **Page Settings** → **General** → **Page Visibility**
2. **Don't restrict visibility** (you want to be found by locals)
3. Instead, use **content targeting** (see below)

**Facebook Ads Manager:**
1. **Always use location targeting** in every ad
2. **Exclude** locations outside your service area
3. **Use radius targeting** (20-30km from Warragul)

**Instagram Settings:**
1. **Business Account** → **Settings** → **Privacy**
2. Review who can tag you (optional restriction)
3. Focus on **content strategy** rather than blocking

- Generic real estate tips (without local context)
- Properties outside Gippsland

1. **Follow local businesses** in Warragul, Drouin, Yarragon, Trafalgar
