# Facebook Fake Followers Cleanup Guide

## The Problem

- 7,000+ fake followers (China, Pakistan, India)
- Affecting Facebook algorithm (90% fake = poor organic reach)
- Privacy concern (sharing client names/addresses with fake accounts)
- Need to clean up before launching paid ads

---

## Why This Matters

### Algorithm Impact:
- Facebook shows your posts to people who engage
- Fake followers don't engage = Facebook thinks your content is bad
- Result: Even real followers don't see your posts
- Paid ads will also underperform with fake audience

### Privacy Concerns:
- Sharing client property details (names, addresses)
- Fake accounts can see this information
- Privacy compliance issues
