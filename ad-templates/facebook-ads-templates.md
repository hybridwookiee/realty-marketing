## Ad Format Best Practices

### Image Ads:
- **Size**: 1200 x 628 pixels (1.91:1 ratio)
- **Text**: Keep text on image minimal (Facebook prefers <20% text)
- **Quality**: High-resolution, professional photos
- **Branding**: Include your logo subtly

### Video Ads:
- **Length**: 15-60 seconds (30 seconds is sweet spot)
- **Format**: Square (1:1) or Landscape (16:9)
- **Hook**: First 3 seconds are critical - grab attention!
- **Captions**: Always add captions (85% watch without sound)
- **CTA**: Include call-to-action in video

### Carousel Ads:
- **Cards**: 3-10 cards (5-7 is optimal)
- **Images**: 1080 x 1080 pixels (square)
- **Consistency**: Keep design/style consistent across cards
- **Story**: Tell a story as user swipes through

---

## Budget Recommendations

### Starting Budget:
- **Daily Budget**: $10-25/day per ad set
- **Monthly Budget**: $300-750/month total
- **Test Multiple Ad Sets**: Start with 3-5 ad sets, $10/day each

### Scaling:
- Once you find winning ads, increase budget 20% every 3-5 days
- Don't increase more than 20% at once (Facebook needs time to optimize)

---

## Campaign Objectives

### For Home Buyers:
- **Objective**: Conversions or Lead Generation
- **Goal**: Form submissions or phone calls

### For Home Sellers:
- **Objective**: Conversions or Lead Generation
- **Goal**: Home valuation form submissions

### For Retargeting:
- **Objective**: Conversions
- **Goal**: Property views, form submissions

---

## Facebook Pixel Setup

**Critical**: Install Facebook Pixel to track conversions and create retargeting audiences.

### Pixel Code (add to website `<head>`):
```html
<!-- Facebook Pixel Code -->
<script>
!function(f,b,e,v,n,t,s)
{if(f.fbq)return;n=f.fbq=function(){n.callMethod?
n.callMethod.apply(n,arguments):n.queue.push(arguments)};
if(!f._fbq)f._fbq=n;n.push=n;n.loaded=!0;n.version='2.0';
n.queue=[];t=b.createElement(e);t.async=!0;
t.src=v;s=b.getElementsByTagName(e)[0];
s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}(window, document,'script',
'https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/fbevents.js');
fbq('init', 'YOUR_PIXEL_ID');
fbq('track', 'PageView');
</script>
<noscript><img height="1" width="1" style="display:none"
src="https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=YOUR_PIXEL_ID&ev=PageView&noscript=1"
/></noscript>
<!-- End Facebook Pixel Code -->
```

### Track Conversions:
```javascript
// When someone submits a form
fbq('track', 'Lead');

// When someone views a property
fbq('track', 'ViewContent', {
  content_name: 'Property Listing',
  content_category: 'Real Estate'
});
```

## A/B Testing Ideas

### Test These Elements:
1. **Ad Copy**: Long vs. short, emotional vs. factual
2. **Images**: Professional photos vs. lifestyle images
3. **Headlines**: Question vs. statement
4. **Call-to-Action**: "Learn More" vs. "Get Started" vs. "Contact Us"
5. **Audiences**: Lookalike 1% vs. 2% vs. Interest-based
6. **Placements**: Feed vs. Stories vs. Messenger

### Testing Best Practices:
- Test ONE variable at a time
- Run tests for at least 7 days (preferably 14)
- Use statistical significance (Facebook will show this)
- Keep winners, pause losers

---

## Expected Results

**Realistic Expectations:**
- **Cost per Click (CPC)**: $0.50-2.00 (much cheaper than Google!)
- **Click-Through Rate (CTR)**: 1-3% (good for Facebook)
- **Cost per Lead**: $10-50 (varies by offer and targeting)
- **Conversion Rate**: 5-15% (if landing page is optimized)

**Example:**
- Budget: $500/month ($16.67/day)
- Clicks: 1,000 (at $0.50 CPC)
- Leads: 50 (at 5% conversion rate)
- Cost per Lead: $10

3. Create your first ad using these templates
4. Start with $10-20/day budget
5. Monitor daily for first week
