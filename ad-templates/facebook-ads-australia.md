## Ad Format Best Practices

### Image Ads:
- **Size**: 1200 x 628 pixels (1.91:1 ratio)
- **Text**: Keep text on image minimal (Facebook prefers <20% text)
- **Quality**: High-resolution, professional photos
- **Branding**: Include @realty logo subtly

### Video Ads:
- **Length**: 15-60 seconds (30 seconds is sweet spot)
- **Format**: Square (1:1) or Landscape (16:9)
- **Hook**: First 3 seconds are critical - grab attention!
- **Captions**: Always add captions (85% watch without sound)
- **CTA**: Include call-to-action in video

### Carousel Ads:
- **Cards**: 3-10 cards (5-7 is optimal)
- **Images**: 1080 x 1080 pixels (square)
- **Consistency**: Keep design/style consistent across cards
- **Story**: Tell a story as user swipes through

---

## Budget Recommendations (AUD)

### Starting Budget:
- **Daily Budget**: $10-25 AUD/day per ad set
- **Monthly Budget**: $300-750 AUD/month total
- **Test Multiple Ad Sets**: Start with 3-5 ad sets, $10 AUD/day each

### Scaling:
- Once you find winning ads, increase budget 20% every 3-5 days
- Don't increase more than 20% at once (Facebook needs time to optimise)

---

## Campaign Objectives

### For Property Appraisals:
- **Objective**: Conversions or Lead Generation
- **Goal**: Appraisal form submissions or phone calls

### For Home Sellers:
- **Objective**: Conversions or Lead Generation
- **Goal**: Property appraisal form submissions

### For Retargeting:
- **Objective**: Conversions
- **Goal**: Property views, form submissions

---

## Facebook Pixel Setup

**Critical**: Install Facebook Pixel to track conversions and create retargeting audiences.

### Pixel Code (add to landing page `<head>`):
```html
<!-- Facebook Pixel Code -->
<script>
!function(f,b,e,v,n,t,s)
{if(f.fbq)return;n=f.fbq=function(){n.callMethod?
n.callMethod.apply(n,arguments):n.queue.push(arguments)};
if(!f._fbq)f._fbq=n;n.push=n;n.loaded=!0;n.version='2.0';
n.queue=[];t=b.createElement(e);t.async=!0;
t.src=v;s=b.getElementsByTagName(e)[0];
s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}(window, document,'script',
'https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/fbevents.js');
fbq('init', 'YOUR_PIXEL_ID');
fbq('track', 'PageView');
</script>
<noscript><img height="1" width="1" style="display:none"
src="https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=YOUR_PIXEL_ID&ev=PageView&noscript=1"
/></noscript>
<!-- End Facebook Pixel Code -->
```

### Track Conversions:
```javascript
// When someone submits an appraisal form
fbq('track', 'Lead');

// When someone views a property
fbq('track', 'ViewContent', {
  content_name: 'Property Listing',
  content_category: 'Real Estate',
  content_ids: ['property-id'],
  value: 0,
  currency: 'AUD'
});
```

---

## A/B Testing Ideas

### Test These Elements:
1. **Ad Copy**: Long vs. short, emotional vs. factual
2. **Images**: Professional photos vs. lifestyle images
3. **Headlines**: Question vs. statement
4. **Call-to-Action**: "Get Free Appraisal" vs. "Learn More" vs. "Contact Us"
5. **Audiences**: Lookalike 1% vs. 2% vs. Interest-based
6. **Placements**: Feed vs. Stories vs. Messenger

### Testing Best Practices:
- Test ONE variable at a time
- Run tests for at least 7 days (preferably 14)
- Use statistical significance (Facebook will show this)
- Keep winners, pause losers

---

## Expected Results (Australian Market)

**Realistic Expectations:**
- **Cost per Click (CPC)**: $0.50-2.00 AUD (much cheaper than Google!)
- **Click-Through Rate (CTR)**: 1-3% (good for Facebook)
- **Cost per Lead**: $10-50 AUD (varies by offer and targeting)
- **Conversion Rate**: 5-15% (if landing page is optimised)
- **Cost per Appraisal**: $20-80 AUD (target: $20-50 AUD)

**Example:**
- Budget: $500 AUD/month ($16.67/day)
- Clicks: 1,000 (at $0.50 AUD CPC)
- Leads: 50 (at 5% conversion rate)
- Cost per Lead: $10 AUD

## Cost Comparison

| Service | King Kong | DIY |
|---------|-----------|-----|
| Campaign Setup | Included | $0 |
| Ad Creative | Included | $0 (use templates) |
| Monthly Management | Included | $0 (your time) |
| Ad Spend | Separate | You control |
| **Total Setup** | **$18,600 AUD** | **$0** |

**You only pay for ad spend, which you'd pay anyway!**

---

## Hashtag Strategy for Facebook

**Best Practice**: Hashtags have minimal impact on Facebook. Use 1-2 local hashtags if desired, or skip them entirely.

### If Using Hashtags (Optional):
- `#GippslandRealEstate`
- `#DrouinProperty`
- `#WarragulRealEstate`

### Avoid:
- ❌ Too many hashtags (looks spammy)
- ❌ Broad hashtags like `#realestate` (not effective on Facebook)
- ❌ Generic tags (Facebook algorithm doesn't rely on hashtags)

**Bottom Line**: Focus on ad copy, targeting, and creative. Hashtags won't significantly impact performance.

---

## Pro Tips

1. **Start with Retargeting**: Cheapest, highest converting audience
2. **Use Video**: Video ads typically perform 2-3x better than images
3. **Test Constantly**: Facebook's algorithm changes, keep testing
4. **Focus on Mobile**: 90%+ of Facebook users are on mobile
5. **Engage Comments**: Respond to every comment quickly
6. **Use Stories**: Facebook Stories ads often have lower CPC
7. **Seasonal Timing**: Real estate is seasonal - adjust budgets accordingly
8. **Local Focus**: Always emphasise Gippsland, Drouin, Trafalgar, Warragul
9. **Hashtags Optional**: Don't stress about hashtags - focus on engagement and targeting

---

## Australian-Specific Notes

- **Location Targeting**: Gippsland, Victoria, Australia
