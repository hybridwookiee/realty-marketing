# Instagram Ads Templates for Australian Real Estate - Gippsland Focus

## Overview
Instagram Ads are powerful for real estate marketing, especially for visual property showcases. Instagram's audience skews younger than Facebook, but still reaches property buyers and sellers. These templates are optimised for the Australian market, focusing on Gippsland property appraisals.

**Key Difference from Facebook**: Instagram is more visual, less text-heavy. Focus on stunning property photos and short, punchy captions.

## Ad Format Best Practices

### Instagram Feed Posts:
- **Size**: 1080 x 1080 pixels (square) OR 1080 x 1350 pixels (portrait)
- **Text**: Minimal text on image - Instagram is visual-first
- **Quality**: High-resolution, professional photos (Instagram users expect high quality)
- **Branding**: Include @realty logo subtly
- **Aspect Ratio**: Square (1:1) or Portrait (4:5) perform best

### Instagram Reels:
- **Length**: 15-90 seconds (30 seconds is sweet spot)
- **Format**: 1080 x 1920 pixels (9:16 vertical)
- **Hook**: First 3 seconds are CRITICAL - grab attention immediately!
- **Captions**: Always add captions (most watch without sound)
- **Text Overlay**: Use text overlays to reinforce key messages
- **Trending Audio**: Use trending sounds when appropriate (but keep it professional)

### Instagram Stories:
- **Size**: 1080 x 1920 pixels (9:16 vertical)
- **Length**: 15 seconds per slide (max 15 slides)
- **Interactive Elements**: Use polls, questions, swipe-up links
- **Text**: Large, readable text (users view on mobile)
- **Stickers**: Use location stickers, hashtag stickers (sparingly)

### Carousel Ads:
- **Cards**: 3-10 cards (5-7 is optimal)
- **Images**: 1080 x 1080 pixels (square)
- **Consistency**: Keep design/style consistent across cards
- **Story**: Tell a story as user swipes through
- **First Image**: Make it count - many users don't swipe

---

## Hashtag Strategy for Instagram

**Best Practice**: Use 3-5 targeted, local hashtags per post.

### Primary Hashtags (Use 2-3 per post):
- `#WarragulRealEstate`
- `#DrouinProperty`
- `#GippslandHomes`
- `#TrafalgarRealEstate`
- `#YarragonProperty`
- `#GippslandLiving`

### Secondary Hashtags (Use 1-2 per post):
- `#PropertyAppraisal`
- `#GippslandRealEstate`
- `#LocalGippsland`
- `#WarragulLife`
- `#DrouinCommunity`

### Avoid:
- ❌ Broad hashtags like `#realestate` (too competitive, attracts wrong audience)
- ❌ Generic tags like `#property` (not local enough)
- ❌ Too many hashtags (looks spammy, Instagram may penalise)

**Placement**: Put hashtags in the caption (not in comments - that's outdated advice).

---

## Budget Recommendations (AUD)

### Starting Budget:
- **Daily Budget**: $10-30 AUD/day per ad set
- **Monthly Budget**: $300-900 AUD/month total
- **Test Multiple Ad Sets**: Start with 3-5 ad sets, $10-15 AUD/day each

### Scaling:
- Once you find winning ads, increase budget 20% every 3-5 days
- Don't increase more than 20% at once (Instagram needs time to optimise)
- Instagram ads can be slightly more expensive than Facebook, but often have better engagement

---

## Campaign Objectives

### For Property Appraisals:
- **Objective**: Conversions or Lead Generation
- **Goal**: Appraisal form submissions or phone calls
- **Alternative**: Traffic (if you want to drive to landing page)

### For Home Sellers:
- **Objective**: Conversions or Lead Generation
- **Goal**: Property appraisal form submissions

### For Retargeting:
- **Objective**: Conversions
- **Goal**: Property views, form submissions

### For Brand Awareness:
- **Objective**: Reach or Brand Awareness
- **Goal**: Get your brand in front of Gippsland homeowners

---

## Instagram Pixel Setup

**Critical**: Install Instagram Pixel (same as Facebook Pixel) to track conversions and create retargeting audiences.

### Pixel Code (same as Facebook Pixel):
```html
<!-- Facebook/Instagram Pixel Code -->
<script>
!function(f,b,e,v,n,t,s)
{if(f.fbq)return;n=f.fbq=function(){n.callMethod?
n.callMethod.apply(n,arguments):n.queue.push(arguments)};
if(!f._fbq)f._fbq=n;n.push=n;n.loaded=!0;n.version='2.0';
n.queue=[];t=b.createElement(e);t.async=!0;
t.src=v;s=b.getElementsByTagName(e)[0];
s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}(window, document,'script',
'https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/fbevents.js');
fbq('init', 'YOUR_PIXEL_ID');
fbq('track', 'PageView');
</script>
<noscript><img height="1" width="1" style="display:none"
src="https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=YOUR_PIXEL_ID&ev=PageView&noscript=1"
/></noscript>
<!-- End Facebook/Instagram Pixel Code -->
```

### Track Conversions:
```javascript
// When someone submits an appraisal form
fbq('track', 'Lead');

// When someone views a property
fbq('track', 'ViewContent', {
  content_name: 'Property Listing',
  content_category: 'Real Estate',
  content_ids: ['property-id'],
  value: 0,
  currency: 'AUD'
});
```

---

## A/B Testing Ideas

### Test These Elements:
1. **Ad Format**: Reels vs. Stories vs. Feed Posts
2. **Ad Copy**: Short vs. long captions
3. **Images**: Professional photos vs. lifestyle images vs. behind-the-scenes
4. **Video Length**: 15s vs. 30s vs. 60s
5. **Hashtags**: 3 hashtags vs. 5 hashtags vs. no hashtags
6. **CTA**: "Link in Bio" vs. "DM Us" vs. "Swipe Up"
7. **Audiences**: Lookalike 1% vs. 2% vs. Interest-based
8. **Placements**: Feed vs. Stories vs. Reels

### Testing Best Practices:
- Test ONE variable at a time
- Run tests for at least 7 days (preferably 14)
- Use statistical significance (Instagram will show this)
- Keep winners, pause losers
- Instagram algorithm changes frequently - keep testing

---

## Expected Results (Australian Market)

**Realistic Expectations:**
- **Cost per Click (CPC)**: $0.60-2.50 AUD (slightly higher than Facebook)
- **Click-Through Rate (CTR)**: 1-4% (Instagram users are more engaged)
- **Cost per Lead**: $12-60 AUD (varies by offer and targeting)
- **Conversion Rate**: 5-15% (if landing page is optimised)
- **Cost per Appraisal**: $25-90 AUD (target: $25-60 AUD)
- **Engagement Rate**: 2-5% (higher than Facebook)

**Example:**
- Budget: $500 AUD/month ($16.67/day)
- Clicks: 800 (at $0.63 AUD CPC)
- Leads: 48 (at 6% conversion rate)
- Cost per Lead: $10.42 AUD

---

## Instagram-Specific Features

### Use These Features:
1. **Swipe-Up Links** (if you have 10k+ followers) OR "Link in Bio"
2. **Story Highlights**: Create highlights for "Free Appraisals", "Properties", "Testimonials"
3. **IGTV/Reels**: Long-form content for property tours
4. **Shopping Tags**: Tag properties if you set up Instagram Shopping
5. **Location Tags**: Always tag Gippsland locations
6. **User-Generated Content**: Repost client testimonials (with permission)

❌ **Not testing** - Always be testing new creatives
❌ **Giving up too early** - Give ads at least 7 days to optimise
❌ **Not tracking conversions** - Install pixel and track everything
❌ **Forgetting mobile** - 100% of users are on mobile
❌ **Inconsistent posting** - Mix ads with organic content

## Instagram vs Facebook Ads

| Feature | Instagram | Facebook |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| **Best For** | Visual content, younger audience | Detailed info, older audience |
| **Ad Formats** | Reels, Stories, Feed | Feed, Stories, Messenger |
| **Text Length** | Short captions | Longer copy OK |
| **Hashtags** | 3-5 recommended | 1-2 optional |
| **Engagement** | Higher engagement rate | Lower engagement rate |
| **CPC** | Slightly higher | Slightly lower |
| **Visual Quality** | Must be high | Can be more casual |

**Recommendation**: Run both! Use Instagram for visual property showcases and Facebook for detailed information and older demographics.
