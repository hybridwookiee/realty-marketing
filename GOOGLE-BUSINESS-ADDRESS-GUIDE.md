## Overview
Your business is located in Buln Buln, but you want to appear in Warragul searches. This guide explains the correct (and Google-compliant) way to handle this.

---

## ⚠️ Important: Google's Rules

### What Google DOES NOT Allow:
- ❌ Using a fake address
- ❌ Using a PO Box as your address
- ❌ Using a virtual office address (unless it's a real, staffed location)
- ❌ Using someone else's address
- ❌ Using an address where you don't actually operate

**Why**: Google verifies addresses. Using a fake address can result in:
- Profile suspension
- Removal from Google Maps
- Loss of reviews
- Damage to your online presence

## ✅ The Correct Solution: Service Area Business

### What It Is:
A Service Area Business is a business that serves customers at their location (like real estate agents, plumbers, etc.) rather than customers coming to your location.

### How It Works:
1. **Your Address**: Use your actual Buln Buln address (this will be hidden from public)
2. **Service Areas**: List all areas you serve (Warragul, Drouin, Yarragon, Trafalgar)
3. **Result**: You appear in searches for all your service areas, including Warragul

### What People Will See:
- **Your Business Name**: Gippsland Property Sales
- **Service Areas**: "Serves Warragul, Drouin, Yarragon, Trafalgar"
- **NO Address Shown**: Your Buln Buln address is hidden
- **You Appear**: In searches like "real estate agent Warragul"
