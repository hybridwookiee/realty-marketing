## URGENT: Facebook Fake Followers Issue

### The Problem:
- 7,000+ fake followers (China, Pakistan, India)
- Affecting Facebook algorithm (90% fake = poor organic reach)
- Privacy concern (sharing client names/addresses with fake accounts)

### Solutions (Choose One):

**Option 1: Clean Up Gradually (Recommended)**
- Use Facebook's "Remove Followers" feature
- Remove 100-200 per day (to avoid triggering spam filters)
- Focus on accounts with no profile picture, foreign names, no posts
- Takes 1-2 months but safer

**Option 2: Start Fresh (If Privacy is Critical)**
- Create new Facebook Business Page
- Keep old page but stop posting there
- Build new audience organically + with ads
- Redirect old page to new one

**Option 3: Use Facebook Audience Insights**
- Go to Facebook Business Suite → Insights → Followers
- Identify fake accounts (no location, no engagement, foreign)
- Remove in batches

**Immediate Action:**
1. Go to Facebook Business Suite
2. Settings → Page Settings → People and Other Pages
3. Start removing obvious fake accounts (no profile pic, foreign names, zero engagement)
4. Do 50-100 per day to avoid issues
