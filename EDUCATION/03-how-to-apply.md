**Daily (10-15 minutes)**:
- Check for new leads (form submissions)
- Respond to leads (or assign to Mel/Jeff)
- Quick check: Are ads running? Any issues?

**Weekly (1-2 hours)**:
- Review performance: How many leads? Cost per lead?
- Check what's working: Which ads perform best?
- Make small adjustments: Pause bad ads, increase good ones
- Plan next week: Any changes needed?

**Monthly (2-3 hours)**:
- Full review: Total leads, appraisals, ROI
- Bigger decisions: Increase budget? Change strategy?
- Learn something new: Read a guide, try a new tactic

**That's it!** Not overwhelming, just consistent.

## Real-World Application: Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: "We Need More Appraisals This Month"

**Situation**: It's the 15th of the month, you only have 15 appraisals (need 50)

**What to Do**:

1. **Check Your Ads** (5 minutes):

   - Add more keywords (if Google Ads)
   - Expand targeting (if Facebook Ads)

3. **Monitor** (Daily for next week):
   - Check if leads increase
   - Adjust if needed

**Real Example**:

- Increase to: $500/month = 18-20 leads
- Result: 3-5 more appraisals this month

**Time Spent**: 20 minutes + 5 minutes/day monitoring

### Scenario 3: "We're Getting Leads, But They're Not Converting"

**What to Do**:

1. **Analyse the Leads** (30 minutes):

**Time Spent**: 1.5 hours + ongoing improvements

### Scenario 4: "A Competitor Is Appearing Before Us on Google"

   - Check their Google Business Profile: More reviews? Better optimised?
   - Check their website: Better SEO?
   - Check if they're running Google Ads

2. **Competitive Response**:

   **If They Have More Reviews**:
   - Get more reviews (ask past clients)
   - Respond to all reviews
   - Time: Ongoing, but important

   **If They Have Better SEO**:
   - Improve your Google Business Profile
   - Create location pages (Warragul, Drouin, etc.)
   - Time: 2-3 hours one-time, then ongoing

   **If They're Running Ads**:

   - Time: 30 minutes to set up

3. **Long-Term Strategy**:

**Time Spent**: Varies, but consistent effort pays off

## How to Make Decisions (Data-Driven)

### The Question: "Should I increase my Google Ads budget?"

**Without Data** (Guessing):
- "I think it's working"
- "Maybe I should increase it"
- "I'll try $100 more"

**With Data** (Smart Decision):
- Last month: $400 spent = 20 leads = $20 per lead
- Cost per appraisal: $50 (good!)
- ROI: Positive (making money)
- **Decision**: Yes, increase budget (it's working)

### The Question: "Should I keep running this Facebook ad?"

**Without Data** (Guessing):
- "I like the ad"
- "It looks good"
- "I'll keep it"

**With Data** (Smart Decision):
- Ad spent: $100
- Leads generated: 2
- Cost per lead: $50 (okay, but not great)
- Other ad spent: $100, leads: 5, cost per lead: $20 (better!)
- **Decision**: Pause the expensive ad, increase budget on the good one
