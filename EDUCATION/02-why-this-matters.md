## Why This Matters for Your Business Goals

### Your Goal: 50 Appraisals Per Month

**Current Situation** (Based on your info):
- Facebook/Instagram (organic - limited reach due to fake followers)
- Newspapers
- DL drops
- Sponsorships (Drouin Country Club, Robin Hood)
- Minimal paid ads ($50 here and there)

**Problem**: 
- Organic reach is limited (Facebook algorithm issues)
- Traditional methods reach fewer people
- Hard to scale (can't easily increase newspaper ads)
- Hard to measure (don't know what's working)

**Solution**: Digital Marketing
- Google Ads: Reach people actively searching
- Facebook Ads: Reach people in your target area
- Email Automation: Nurture leads over time
- Measurable: See exactly what works

**Result**: Predictable flow of appraisal requests

## The Math That Matters

### Traditional Marketing (Current):

**Newspaper Ad**: $500/month
- Reach: ~5,000 people
- Response rate: 0.1% (5 people)
- Cost per lead: $100
- Quality: Unknown

**DL Drops**: $300/month
- Reach: ~2,000 homes
- Response rate: 0.2% (4 people)
- Cost per lead: $75
- Quality: Unknown

**Total**: $800/month = 9 leads = $89 per lead

### Digital Marketing (Proposed):

**Google Ads**: $400/month
- Reach: People actively searching
- Response rate: 2-5% (8-20 people)
- Cost per lead: $20-50
- Quality: High (they're searching for you)

**Facebook Ads**: $200/month
- Reach: Targeted local audience
- Response rate: 1-3% (2-6 people)
- Cost per lead: $33-100
- Quality: Medium-High

**Total**: $600/month = 10-26 leads = $23-60 per lead

**Better ROI**: Digital marketing gives you more leads for less money, and you can see exactly what's working.
