## What is Digital Marketing?

**Simple Definition**: Digital marketing is using the internet (websites, Google, Facebook, email) to find and connect with people who want to buy or sell property.

**Real-World Example**: 
- Traditional marketing: Putting an ad in the local newspaper
- Digital marketing: Showing up when someone searches "property appraisal Warragul" on Google

---

## Why Does This Matter for Real Estate?

### The Old Way (Still Works, But Limited):
- **Word of mouth**: People tell friends about you
- **Signs**: "For Sale" signs on properties
- **Newspapers**: Ads in local papers
- **Flyers**: Dropping leaflets in letterboxes

**Problem**: You can only reach people who:
- Already know about you
- See your sign
- Read the newspaper
- Get your flyer

### The New Way (Digital Marketing):
- **Google**: People search "property appraisal Warragul" → You appear
- **Facebook**: People see your ad in their feed
- **Email**: You send helpful information to people who are interested
- **Website**: People find you online 24/7

**Benefit**: You can reach people who:
- Are actively looking (searching on Google)
- Don't know you exist yet
- Are researching online
- Are ready to take action

## How Digital Marketing Works (Simple Explanation)

### The Funnel Concept:

Think of it like a funnel (wide at top, narrow at bottom):

```
                    AWARENESS
                  (Many people)
                        │
                        ▼
                   INTEREST
                (Some people)
                        │
                        ▼
                  CONSIDERATION
               (Fewer people)
                        │
                        ▼
                    ACTION
              (Few people - but ready!)
```

### Real Example for Property Appraisals:

1. **Awareness** (Top of Funnel):
   - Someone sees your Facebook ad: "Free Property Appraisal in Warragul"
   - They're not ready yet, but they see your name

2. **Interest** (Middle of Funnel):
   - They click your ad → Go to your website
   - They read about your services
   - They're interested but not ready to commit

3. **Consideration** (Narrowing):
   - They fill out a form: "Tell me more"
   - You send them helpful emails
   - They're thinking about it

4. **Action** (Bottom of Funnel):
   - They request an appraisal
   - Mel or Jeff calls them
   - Appraisal scheduled → Potential listing

## The Three Main Types of Digital Marketing

### 1. Search Marketing (Google Ads)

**What it is**: Showing up when people search on Google

**Example**: 
- Someone types: "property appraisal Warragul"
- Your ad appears at the top
- They click → Go to your website → Request appraisal

**Why it works**: 
- People are actively looking
- High intent (they want something now)
- You appear exactly when they need you

**Cost**: You pay per click (usually $2-8 AUD per click)

---

### 2. Social Media Marketing (Facebook/Instagram Ads)

**What it is**: Showing ads to people on Facebook/Instagram

**Example**:
- Someone scrolling Facebook sees your ad: "Get Your Free Property Appraisal"
- They're not searching, but they're interested
- They click → Learn more → Request appraisal

**Why it works**:
- Reaches people who aren't actively searching
- Builds awareness
- Can target specific areas (Warragul, Drouin, etc.)

**Cost**: Usually cheaper than Google ($0.50-2 AUD per click)

---

### 3. Email Marketing (Automated Emails)

**What it is**: Sending helpful emails to people who showed interest

**Example**:
- Someone fills out your form
- They automatically get a welcome email
- Then they get helpful emails over time
- Eventually they're ready → Request appraisal

**Why it works**:
- Keeps you top-of-mind
- Builds trust over time
- Converts "not ready yet" into "ready now"

**Cost**: Usually free (up to certain limits)

5. Phone Call (Mel/Jeff follow up)

   - Digital: You control how many leads you get
   - Spend $600/month → Get 20-50 leads → Turn into listings

   - Digital ads: Know exactly what works
   - Can see: "This ad got 10 appraisals, that one got 2"

4. **Competitive Advantage**:
   - Many real estate agents don't do digital marketing well
   - You'll be ahead of competitors
   - First to appear when people search

**Reality**: You control the budget. Start with $600/month. If it works, increase. If it doesn't, adjust.
